# Each .yml or .md file in each of those folders will
# represent an instance of the relevant model, with
# the file name of the file itself becoming the
# primary key of that particular instance. So,
# a file called michael.yml in the data/Author
# folder will be inserted as an entry whose primary
# key is michael into the Author in-memory database table.
